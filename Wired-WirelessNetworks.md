## Twisted-Pair Cable
- wired networks are still the most common type of physical connection that computers make
- **twisted-pair cable** is the most commonly used cable in local area networks
    - easy to work with and is efficient
    - a single cable has **eight wires**, made of **copper conductors** that transmits electric signals
        - these *8* wires are grouped into **4 pairs**, blue, orange (transmitting), green (receiving), and brown
        - the wires are **twisted** is to reduce crosstalk and interference
## Types of Patch Cables
- straight through cable
    - most common type of patch cable
    - used to connect to a computer to a central connecting device like a switch
- crossover cable
    - used to connect like devices to each other, a computer to another computer, or a switch to another switch

## MDI and MDI-X Ports
- network adapters normally have an MDI port (**medium dependent interface**)
- in order for computers to communicate with other devices, they wires have to cross somewhere
    - instead of using crossover cables to connect computers to central connecting devices such as switches, the CCDs are given MDI-X ports which handles the cross
- to make connections between patch panel and rj-45 jacks requires **cutting tool, wire stripper, punch down tool, and a testing device(continuity tester which tests all the pins)**
## Attenuation
- twisted-pair cables can go 100m before signal degrades indefinitely
    - if it needs to be ran farther, we need a *signal repeater, a hub, or switch*
    - otherwise, the fiber optic cable is the solution because is can run much farther
## Twisted-Pair Categories
- twisted-pair cables categorized according to the frequency at which they transmit signals and their data transfer rate/speed
- category 3: 10mbps
- category 5: 100mbps
- category 5e: 100mbps and Gigabit networks
- category 6: Gigabit networks
- category 7a: 10 Gigabit networks

## Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
- disturbance that affects electrical circuits, devices, and cables due to electromagnetic conduction and maybe radiation
    - any electrical device can cause EMI
    - copper-based cables and network devices should be kept away from these electrical devices and cables
- invest into **Shielded Twisted-Pair Cables** which have aluminum shielding inside plastic jacket surrounding the wires
## Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
- interference that can come from AM/FM transmissions and cell phone towers
- part of EMI family
- filters can be installed on network to eliminate signal frequency being broadcast by a radio tower

## Data Emanation
- major issue with data networks and those using copper-based cabling is **data emanation(signal emanation)**
- this is EM field that is generated by a network cable or device, which can be manipulated to eavesdrop or steal data
- data emanation is the most commonly seen security risk when using coaxial cable, but can also be a risk for other copper-based cables such as **twisted pair**
    - there are various ways to get into these EM fields in order to get unauthorized access to data
    - to alleviate, you could use EM shielding on devices that might be emanating an electromagnetic field
## Crosstalk
- another interference that occurs when the signal that is transmitted on one copper wire or pair of wires creates an undesired effect on another
    - in twisted-pair cabling, there is NEXT (near end) when there is interference between two pairs in a single cable measured on cable end nearest the transmitter
    - FEXT (far end) interference occurs at the cable end farthest from transmitter
- **plenum-rated**:
    - cables that should be installed where it cannot be prone to sprinklers, etc. these should be plenum-rated or low-smoke rated
- **fiber-optic cable**:
    - transmits light (photons) instead of electricity and is transmitted over glass or plastic
        - glass is the media for fiber optics like how copper is the media for twisted-pair cabling
    - types:
        - single-mode: meant to carry a single ray of light within an optical fiber
        - used for longer distance runs (generally 10km and up to 80km)
        - multi-mode: larger fiber core, carries multiple rays of light, used for shorter distance (up to 600m)
- in wireless networks: some wireless devices can be connected to eachother in a point-to-point fashion or might offer extension of connectivity
    - the most well-known wireless device is the wireless access point
        - acts as a router, firewall, and IP proxy
    - a wireless repeater is used to extend the coverage of a wireless network
        - WLANs only have a range of about 100 feet
        - a wireless bridge is similar to wireless repeater, but the bridge can connect different 802.11 standards together known as *bridge mode*
    - wireless LAN or **WLAN** is a network composed of at least one **WAP** and one other device, usually networks are ethernet based 
        - to ensure compatibility, the WAP and device must all use the same IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard
        - **WLAN Standards**:
        - 802.11a - 54Mbps - 5GHz
        - 802.11b - 11 Mbps - 2.4GHz
        - 802.11g - 54 Mbps - 2.4GHz
        - 802.11n - 600Mbps - 5GHz and or 2.4 GHz
- wireless encryption options:
    - WEP: wired equivalent privacy : 64-bit
    - WPA2: WI-FI protected access : 256-bit
    - TKIP : temporal key integrity protocol : 128-bit
    - AES : advanced encryption standard : 18-, 192-, 256-bit
- wireless modes: ways to connect to a wireless network...
    - infrastructure mode: when wireless clients connect to and are authenticated by a WAP
        - configured with a service set identifier (SSID) which is the name of network
    - ad-hoc mode: all of the clients communicate directly with each other
## Summary
- Twisted-pair cable is the most common cable used in local area networks. It’s relatively easy to work with, flexible, efficient, and fast. 
- Twisted-pair cables are the most common of all copper-based cables. A single twisted-pair cable has eight wires; they are insulation-covered copper conductors that transmit electric signals. 
- Twisted-pair cables are categorized according to the number of twists per foot, the maximum data rate, and the frequency of the transmit signal that the cable reliably supports.
- Fiber-optic cable is used when longer distance runs are needed and even higher data transfer rates are necessary. 
- Fiber-optic cables are used as part of the backbone of the fastest networks. However, they are far more difficult to install, maintain, and troubleshoot.
- Wireless devices might allow for central connectivity of client computers and handheld devices. Or, they might offer an extension of connectivity to a preexisting wireless network, and could be used to connect entire local area networks to the internet. In addition, some wireless devices can be connected directly to each other in a point-to-point fashion. 
- There are a couple of different ways to connect to a wireless network—primarily infrastructure mode and ad hoc mode.
